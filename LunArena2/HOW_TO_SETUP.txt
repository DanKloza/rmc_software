You are in this folder: ../src/LunArena2/

Make sure you stay in this folder, and then type this below:
mkdir ~/.gazebo/models/LunArena2

Then type 
cp -r * ~/.gazebo/models/LunArena2

You should now have the launch, meshes, textures, robots folders in the .gazebo/models/LunArena2 folder. Along with that the rmc_simulation.sdf and the model.config. MAKE SURE ALL THE FILES ARE THERE.
